## Features

* **`Real Time Messaging`**: You can send and receive text messages, images files instantly with other users. Discord Clone uses Firebase to enable real-time communication between the clients.

* **`Blazing Fast`**: Discord Clone caches messages in your browser using **IndexedDB**, a low-level API for client-side storage. This means you can access your messages even when you are offline or have a slow connection. IndexedDB also allows for faster loading and rendering of messages, as well as efficient querying and sorting of data.

* **`Personal DMs`**: You can chat privately with any user on Discord Clone. You can start a conversation by clicking on their username or avatar, or by searching for them in the user list.

* **`Public Servers (Communities)`**: You can join public servers on Discord Clone, where you can chat with other users who share your interests.
